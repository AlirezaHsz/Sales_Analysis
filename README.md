In this mini project, I analyzed the sales data of a company in US. The analysis was trying to answer the questions below:
# Question 1: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
# Question 2: What city has the highest sales?
# Question 3: What time should we display advertisements to maximize likehood of customers buying products?
# Question 4: What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?
